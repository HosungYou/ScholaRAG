# Release Notes: ResearcherRAG v1.1.0

**Release Date**: 2025-10-11 (In Progress)
**Type**: Major Feature Release (Workshop Pivot)
**Status**: 🚧 Development Build

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

ResearcherRAG v1.1.0 represents a **fundamental pivot** in project direction:

**From**: Web-based RAG service with frontend UI and backend API
**To**: Educational materials for building RAG systems with Claude Code in VS Code

**Why**: Researchers work in IDEs, not web browsers. They need terminal access for PDF downloads, Python execution, and file system operations. Conversational setup with AI assistance is more intuitive than form-based configuration.

**Impact**: Enables non-programmers to build custom RAG systems through guided conversation, reducing learning curve from weeks to hours.

---

## 🆕 What's New

### 1. Comprehensive Claude Code Guide (CLAUDE.md)

**File**: `CLAUDE.md` (18,000 words)

**What It Is**: Complete instruction manual for Claude Code on how to guide researchers through RAG system construction.

**Key Sections**:
- **5-Stage Workflow**: Research Domain Setup → Query Strategy → PRISMA Configuration → RAG Design → Execution
- **Conversation Examples**: Sample dialogues showing how to interact with researchers
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Solutions for 10+ common issues
- **Domain Templates**: Education, Medicine, Psychology research patterns
- **Best Practices**: Communication style, error handling, code quality standards

**Why It Matters**: Claude Code now "understands" research workflows and can guide researchers conversationally without requiring programming knowledge.

**Example Usage**:
```
Researcher opens VS Code with project folder
→ Starts Claude Code chat
→ Pastes prompt from prompts/01_research_domain_setup.md
→ Claude reads CLAUDE.md and provides expert guidance
→ Researcher builds complete RAG system through conversation
```

---

### 2. Stage-by-Stage Prompt Templates

**Location**: `prompts/` folder

**What It Is**: Copy-paste templates for each workflow stage, designed for researchers to use directly with Claude Code.

#### Stage 1: Research Domain Setup
**File**: `prompts/01_research_domain_setup.md`
**Purpose**: Define research scope, field, questions, and constraints
**Duration**: 15-20 minutes
**Output**: Clear research domain understanding + keyword list

**Features**:
- Fill-in-the-blank template (research topic, field, questions, constraints)
- Examples for Education and Medicine domains
- Tips for effective scope definition
- Expected paper count estimation

#### Stage 2: Query Strategy Design
**File**: `prompts/02_query_strategy.md`
**Purpose**: Design effective search queries for academic databases
**Duration**: 10-15 minutes
**Output**: Optimized search queries (broad/focused/narrow options)

**Features**:
- Boolean operator cheat sheet (AND, OR, NOT)
- Query trade-offs table (papers found vs. relevance rate)
- Decision tree for query selection
- Multi-source strategy (Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, arXiv, PubMed)
- Example queries for Education and Medicine

#### Stages 3-5 (Coming Soon)
- **Stage 3**: PRISMA Configuration (20-30 min)
- **Stage 4**: RAG Design (15-20 min)
- **Stage 5**: Execution Plan (10 min)

**Why It Matters**: Researchers don't need to figure out what to ask Claude. They follow structured prompts that have been tested and refined.

### 5. Documentation Reorganization

#### New Structure
```
ResearcherRAG/
├── CLAUDE.md (renamed, comprehensive)
├── prompts/ (stage templates)
├── workshop/ (teaching materials)
├── templates/ (code & profile templates)
├── examples/ (sample projects)
├── backend/core/ (core implementation)
├── project_management/ (TODO, ROADMAP, CHANGELOG)
├── release-notes/ (version history)
└── .archive/ (obsolete files preserved)
```

#### What Got Archived (Not Deleted)
**Location**: `.archive/` folder

**Frontend Plans** → `.archive/frontend_plans/`
- vercel_frontend_strategy.md
- Vercel-Frontend-Detailed-Strategy.md

**Old Module Docs** → `.archive/old_modules/`
- module_1_basic_rag_concept.md

- RAG-Value-Creation-Strategy.md
- RAG-for-Researchers-Practical-Strategy.md

**Deployment Guides** → `.archive/old_docs/`
- deployment_huggingface_guide.md
- DEPLOYMENT.md (from 01_literature_review_rag)

**Duplicates** → `.archive/old_docs/`
- CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPTS.md (superseded by prompts/ folder)
- PROJECT_SUMMARY.md (outdated)
- ACLOD_Summit_Abstract.md (conference-specific)
- Release Notes/2025-10-03_Initial_Release.md (duplicate)

**Why Archive Instead of Delete**:

### 6. Core Code Reorganization

#### Before
```
01_literature_review_rag/
├── backend/core/ (scattered implementation)
└── config/research_profiles/ (profiles)
```

#### After
```
backend/core/ (centralized)
├── prisma_pipeline.py
├── research_profile.py
├── prisma_integration.py
├── rag_graph.py
├── retrieval.py
├── ingestion.py
├── config.py
└── __init__.py

templates/research_profiles/ (organized)
├── default.yaml
└── hrm_ai_bias.yaml
```

**Why It Matters**:
- Clearer project structure
- Easier to find core implementation
- Better separation of code vs. templates
- Prepares for deprecation of `01_literature_review_rag/` in v1.2.0

### Learning Outcomes

After completing the workshop, participants will be able to:

1. **Design Effective Search Strategies**
   - Construct boolean queries for academic databases
   - Balance comprehensiveness vs. precision
   - Use multiple data sources (Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, etc.)

2. **Implement PRISMA Systematic Reviews**
   - Configure multi-dimensional relevance scoring
   - Set appropriate thresholds for screening stages
   - Generate PRISMA flow diagrams

3. **Build Custom RAG Systems**
   - Understand RAG architecture (embedding, retrieval, generation)
   - Configure vector databases (ChromaDB)
   - Design academic-focused prompts for citation quality

4. **Troubleshoot Common Issues**
   - Handle low PDF download success rates
   - Adjust PRISMA configurations when results are off
   - Improve RAG answer quality through prompt engineering

5. **Work Conversationally with AI**
   - Structure prompts for effective AI guidance

   - Understand AI suggestions and make informed decisions

### Time Savings (Real-world Examples)

Based on AI failure_HR project experience:

**Traditional Systematic Review**:
- Manual screening: 20,555 papers × 2 min/paper = **684 hours** (17 weeks full-time)

**RAG-Assisted Review (v1.0.0)**:
- Automated PRISMA: 20,555 papers → 592 papers in **2 hours**
- Manual review: 592 papers × 15 min/paper = **148 hours** (4 weeks)
- **Total: 4 weeks** (75% reduction)

**With v1.1.0 Workshop Training**:
- Setup time: **3 hours** (one-time learning)
- Per-project time: **4 weeks** (same as above)
- **ROI**: After 2nd project, positive return on learning investment

## 🐛 Known Issues

### High Priority (Blocking v1.1.0 Release)

1. **Prompt Templates Incomplete**
   - ❌ Stage 3 (PRISMA Configuration) - Not yet created
   - ❌ Stage 4 (RAG Design) - Not yet created
   - ❌ Stage 5 (Execution Plan) - Not yet created
   - **Impact**: Researchers can't complete full workflow
   - **ETA**: 2-3 days

2. **No Example Projects**
   - ❌ ai_education_chatbot - Partially documented but no code
   - **Impact**: No reference for researchers to follow
   - **ETA**: 1 week

3. **README Outdated**
   - Current README describes v1.0.0 web service approach
   - **Impact**: Confusing for new users
   - **ETA**: 1 day

### Medium Priority (Can Ship Without)

4. **No Code Templates**
   - Scripts 1-6 not yet created as templates
   - Researchers must rely on Claude to generate from scratch
   - **Impact**: Slower setup, potential errors
   - **Workaround**: Claude Code can generate on demand
   - **ETA**: 3-4 days

5. **No Research Profile Templates**
   - Only default.yaml and hrm_ai_bias.yaml exist
   - Need education_template, medicine_template, social_science_template
   - **Impact**: Researchers start from blank slate
   - **Workaround**: Claude can generate custom profiles
   - **ETA**: 1 day

### Low Priority (Future Enhancement)

6. **Workshop Slides Not Created**
   - hands_on_guide.md exists but no presentation slides
   - **Impact**: Instructors must create their own
   - **Workaround**: Use hands_on_guide.md as speaking notes
   - **ETA**: 1 week

7. **No Sample Data**
   - Workshop requires pre-downloaded PDFs for demo
   - **Impact**: Participants wait during PDF download (slow)
   - **Workaround**: Use smaller dataset (20 papers) or skip PDF step
   - **ETA**: Depends on data source availability
