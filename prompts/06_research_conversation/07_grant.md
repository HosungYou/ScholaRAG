üî¨ FUTURE RESEARCH PROPOSAL: Grant-Ready Study Design

**Based on**: Systematic review of 45 papers revealing critical research gaps

---

## üéØ Research Question

**Primary RQ**:
What is the minimum effective duration and frequency of AI chatbot practice required to produce sustained speaking proficiency gains in university-level language learners?

**Secondary RQs**:
1. Do gains persist after chatbot access is removed (3-month and 6-month follow-ups)?
2. Does the effect differ for beginner vs. intermediate learners (proficiency moderator)?
3. What is the optimal dosage (sessions/week √ó minutes/session √ó weeks)?

---

## üí° Hypotheses

**H1**: Minimum threshold exists at 8 weeks of practice (consistent with gap analysis)
- H1a: 4-week intervention will show d<0.20 (non-significant)
- H1b: 8-week intervention will show d‚â•0.50 (medium effect)
- H1c: 12-week intervention will show d‚â•0.65 (medium-large effect)

**H2**: Frequency matters more than total duration
- H2a: Daily practice (5√ó/week) will outperform twice-weekly (2√ó/week) even with equivalent total minutes

**H3**: Gains will decay without continued practice
- H3a: 50% of gains lost by 3-month follow-up (no continued access)
- H3b: 80% of gains retained if optional continued access provided

**H4**: Proficiency level moderates effect
- H4a: Beginners (A2) will show larger gains (d‚â•0.70)
- H4b: Intermediates (B1-B2) will show moderate gains (d‚â•0.45)

**Rationale**: Based on gap analysis showing:
- Lack of dosage studies (only 2 studies manipulated duration)
- No retention studies beyond 3 months (0 studies with 6-month follow-up)
- Proficiency rarely tested as moderator (only 3 studies)

---

## üìê Study Design

### Design Type: Factorial Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)

**Factorial Structure**: 3√ó2√ó2 mixed design
- Factor 1 (Between-subjects): Duration (4 weeks vs. 8 weeks vs. 12 weeks)
- Factor 2 (Between-subjects): Frequency (2√ó/week vs. 5√ó/week)
- Factor 3 (Within-subjects): Proficiency Level (Beginner A2 vs. Intermediate B1-B2)

**Total Conditions**: 6 between-subjects groups
1. 4 weeks, 2√ó/week (control dose)
2. 4 weeks, 5√ó/week
3. 8 weeks, 2√ó/week
4. 8 weeks, 5√ó/week
5. 12 weeks, 2√ó/week
6. 12 weeks, 5√ó/week (maximum dose)

---

### Sample

**Target N**: 360 participants (60 per condition √ó 6 conditions)

**Recruitment**:
- University language learners (ages 18-30)
- Studying English as L2
- Proficiency: A2 (beginner) or B1-B2 (intermediate) on CEFR scale

**Exclusion Criteria**:
- ‚ùå Native English speakers
- ‚ùå Previous chatbot experience (>2 hours)
- ‚ùå Speech/hearing impairments
- ‚ùå Planning to study abroad during study period

**Power Analysis**:
- Expected effect size: d=0.50 (medium)
- Alpha: 0.05
- Power: 0.80
- Required n per group: 51
- Recruit 60 per group (assuming 15% attrition)

---

### Measures

#### Primary Outcome: Speaking Proficiency

**Instrument**: IELTS Speaking Test (standardized, widely validated)

**Subscales**:
- Fluency and Coherence (0-9)
- Lexical Resource (0-9)
- Grammatical Range and Accuracy (0-9)
- Pronunciation (0-9)
- Overall Band Score (0-9)

**Administration**:
- Trained raters (certified IELTS examiners)
- Video-recorded for inter-rater reliability (20% double-scored)
- Target IRR: Kappa ‚â• 0.80

**Timing**:
- Baseline (Week 0)
- Immediate post-test (Week 4, 8, or 12 depending on condition)
- 3-month follow-up
- 6-month follow-up

---

#### Secondary Outcomes

**1. Objective Fluency Metrics** (automated analysis):
- Speech rate (words per minute)
- Pause frequency and duration
- Mean length of utterance (MLU)
- **Tool**: PRAAT speech analysis software

**2. Learner Self-Assessment**:
- Perceived speaking proficiency (7-point Likert)
- Speaking anxiety (Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale)
- Chatbot usability (System Usability Scale)

**3. Engagement Metrics** (from chatbot logs):
- Total practice time (minutes)
- Number of chatbot conversations
- Average session length
- Adherence rate (% of prescribed sessions completed)

**4. Implementation Fidelity**:
- Dosage received (actual vs. prescribed)
- Technical issues log
- Participant satisfaction ratings

---

### Intervention

**Chatbot Platform**: LLM-based conversational AI (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)

**Conversation Topics**: Aligned with IELTS Speaking Part 1-3
- Personal topics (hobbies, family, work)
- Abstract topics (environment, technology, culture)
- Opinion discussions (agree/disagree, advantages/disadvantages)

**Session Structure** (30 minutes):
1. Warm-up (5 min): Greeting, topic selection
2. Conversation (20 min): Back-and-forth dialogue
3. Feedback (5 min): Chatbot provides pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary feedback

**Scaffolding**:
- Adaptive difficulty (chatbot adjusts to proficiency level)
- Vocabulary hints available on request
- Option to repeat/rephrase if misunderstood

---

### Control Group

**Modified Control**: All participants receive intervention (dosage varies)
- No "no treatment" control (unethical to withhold beneficial intervention)
- 4-week, 2√ó/week group serves as "minimal dose" control

**Justification**: Compare dosage levels rather than intervention vs. nothing

---

## üìä Analysis Plan

### Primary Analysis: Mixed-Effects ANOVA

**Model**:
```
Speaking Proficiency ~ Duration √ó Frequency √ó Proficiency Level √ó Time + (1|Participant)
```

**Fixed Effects**:
- Duration (4, 8, 12 weeks)
- Frequency (2√ó, 5√ó per week)
- Proficiency Level (A2, B1-B2)
- Time (baseline, post, 3mo, 6mo)
- All interactions

**Random Effect**:
- Participant (repeated measures)

**Contrasts**:
- Compare each duration level (4 vs. 8, 8 vs. 12)
- Compare frequencies within each duration
- Test proficiency moderator

---

### Secondary Analyses

**1. Dose-Response Curve**:
- Total practice time (minutes) as continuous predictor
- Non-linear models (quadratic, piecewise regression) to identify threshold

**2. Retention Analysis**:
- Decay rate from post-test to 3-month and 6-month follow-ups
- Compare participants with vs. without continued access (exploratory)

**3. Mediation Analysis**:
- Test whether engagement (time spent) mediates duration effect
- Use structural equation modeling (SEM)

**4. Moderated Mediation**:
- Does proficiency level moderate mediation pathway?

**5. Implementation Fidelity Analysis**:
- Adherence as predictor of outcomes
- Per-protocol analysis (only participants with ‚â•80% adherence)

---

### Sample Size Justification

**Power Calculation Details**:
- Main effect of duration: f=0.25 (medium)
- Duration √ó Frequency interaction: f=0.20 (small-medium)
- Power: 0.80, Alpha: 0.05
- Required N=360 (G*Power 3.1)

**Sensitivity Analysis**:
- Minimum detectable effect size with N=360: d=0.35
