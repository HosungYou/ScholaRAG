## Part 2: Writing with RAG Assistance

### Using Your RAG System to Draft Sections

**Methods Section**:
```
Prompt your RAG system:

"Generate a Methods section for my systematic review. Include:
- Databases: [list databases you searched]
- Search dates: [dates]
- Search strategy: [Boolean queries from Stage 2]
- Inclusion criteria: [from Stage 3]
- Number of papers at each stage: Identification (n=1247), Screening (n=289), Eligible (n=156), Included (n=137)
- Data extraction: Used ResearcherRAG with Claude API for screening and LangChain for vector search
- Analysis: Thematic synthesis using conversational AI analysis"
```

**Results - Study Characteristics**:
```
"Create a summary table of the 137 included studies with these columns:
- Author, Year
- Study Design
- Sample Size
- Setting (country/context)
- Main Findings

Group by study design and sort by year."
```

**Results - Thematic Synthesis**:
```
"Synthesize all findings related to [your theme]. Structure as:
1. Overview paragraph
2. Sub-theme 1 with supporting citations
3. Sub-theme 2 with supporting citations
4. Summary paragraph

Use APA citation format [Author, Year]"
```

**Discussion**:
```
"Help me write a discussion section that:
1. Summarizes the main findings from my results
2. Compares my findings to [cite relevant reviews]
3. Discusses implications for [your field]
4. Acknowledges limitations
5. Suggests future research directions"
```

---

## Part 3: Citation & Bibliography Management

### Generating Your Bibliography

**Step 1: Export All Cited Papers**

```python
# If using claude_code_interface.py

# Track citations during research
cited_papers = set()

# After each query, extract citations
import re
citations = re.findall(r'\[([^\]]+)\]', llm_response)
cited_papers.update(citations)

# At the end
print(f"Total papers cited: {len(cited_papers)}")
with open('cited_papers.txt', 'w') as f:
    for paper_id in sorted(cited_papers):
        f.write(f"{paper_id}\n")
```

**Step 2: Generate Bibliography**

```
Ask your RAG system:

"For each of these paper IDs, generate a full citation in APA format:
[list of paper_ids from your research]

Include: Author(s), Year, Title, Journal, Volume(Issue), Pages, DOI"
```

**Step 3: Verify and Format**

```python
# bibliography_generator.py

import bibtexparser

def generate_bibliography(cited_papers, metadata_file, format='apa'):
    """
    Generate bibliography from cited papers

    Args:
        cited_papers: list of paper IDs cited
        metadata_file: CSV/JSON with paper metadata
        format: 'apa', 'chicago', 'ieee', 'bibtex'
    """

    import pandas as pd
    metadata = pd.read_csv(metadata_file)

    bibliography = []
    for paper_id in sorted(cited_papers):
        paper = metadata[metadata['paper_id'] == paper_id].iloc[0]

        if format == 'apa':
            citation = format_apa(paper)
        elif format == 'bibtex':
            citation = format_bibtex(paper)
        # ... other formats

        bibliography.append(citation)

    return '\n\n'.join(bibliography)

def format_apa(paper):
    """Format single paper in APA style"""
    authors = paper['authors']  # "Smith, J., & Johnson, M."
    year = paper['year']
    title = paper['title']
    journal = paper['journal']
    volume = paper['volume']
    issue = paper['issue']
    pages = paper['pages']
    doi = paper['doi']

    citation = f"{authors} ({year}). {title}. *{journal}*, *{volume}*({issue}), {pages}. https://doi.org/{doi}"

    return citation
```

            'studies': 137,
            'reports': 137
        }
    }
    """

    # Use matplotlib or plotly to create diagram
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import matplotlib.patches as patches

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 14))

    # ... (PRISMA box layout code)

### Disclosure Statement

**Include in your Methods section:**

```markdown
## AI-Assisted Screening and Analysis

This systematic review utilized AI-assisted tools for literature screening and analysis:

1. **Initial Screening (Stage 3)**:
   - Claude 3.5 Sonnet was used to assess abstracts against inclusion criteria
   - Each decision was reviewed by a human researcher
   - Inter-rater reliability: Îº = 0.89

2. **Data Extraction (Stage 4)**:
   - Papers were processed using OpenAI text-embedding-3-small for vector representation
   - Stored in ChromaDB vector database
   - Full text extraction performed with PyMuPDF

3. **Literature Analysis (Stage 6)**:
   - Claude 3.5 Sonnet was used to answer research questions based on retrieved paper chunks
   - All generated citations were manually verified against source papers
   - Critical findings were cross-referenced with original PDFs

4. **Validation**:
   - 10% of screening decisions were independently verified
   - All citations in final manuscript were validated
   - No AI-generated text appears in the manuscript without human review and editing

5. **Reproducibility**:
   - Complete code and configuration available at [GitHub URL]
   - Vector database snapshot available upon request
   - All prompts documented in supplementary materials
