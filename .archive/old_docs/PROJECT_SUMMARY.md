## 🎯 Three RAG Systems Documented

### 1. Literature Review RAG 📚

**Purpose**: Analyze 200+ research papers, synthesize findings, support meta-analysis

**Technology**:
- **Framework**: LangGraph (multi-step workflow)
- **Workflow**: Query Decomposition → Retrieval → Reranking → Synthesis

**Features**:
- Semantic search across corpus
- Automatic citation tracking
- Research gap identification
- Meta-analysis data extraction
- Export to Excel/CSV

**Use Cases**:
- Systematic literature reviews
- Dissertation literature chapter
- Grant proposal background
- Research synthesis

**Performance**: 10x faster than manual review

---

### 2. Qualitative Coding RAG 🎤

**Purpose**: AI-assisted thematic analysis of interview transcripts

**Technology**:
- **Framework**: LangGraph (iterative, stateful)
- **Workflow**: Initial Coding → Apply to Data → Refine → Generate Themes

**Features**:
- Inductive & deductive coding
- Hierarchical theme generation
- Inter-rater reliability support
- Export to NVivo/Atlas.ti
- Human-in-the-loop validation

**Use Cases**:
- Interview studies
- Focus group analysis
- Open-ended survey responses
- Field notes coding

**Performance**: 10-20x faster initial coding (with human validation)

---

### 3. Research Notes RAG 📝

**Purpose**: Personal knowledge management for researchers

**Technology**:
- **Framework**: LangChain (simple conversational chain)
- **Workflow**: Query → Retrieve → Answer with Memory

**Features**:
- Markdown notes integration
- Obsidian sync (bi-directional)
- Temporal search ("what I thought in June 2023")
- Automated synthesis
- Writing assistance

**Use Cases**:
- Literature notes management
- Idea capture and connection
- Research journaling
- Grant writing support

**Performance**: 60x faster than manual searching

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions (Key Insights)

### LangGraph vs LangChain: When to Use What

**Use LangGraph when:**
- ✅ Multi-step workflows (query decomposition, reranking)
- ✅ Conditional logic needed
- ✅ Human-in-the-loop interaction
- ✅ State persistence required (checkpointing)
- ✅ Complex debugging needed (graph visualization)

**Use LangChain when:**
- ✅ Simple Q&A with context
- ✅ Conversational memory needed
- ✅ Speed is priority
- ✅ Prototyping quickly

**Our Decisions**:
- Literature Review: **LangGraph** (complex retrieval)
- Qualitative Coding: **LangGraph** (iterative refinement)
- Research Notes: **LangChain** (simple chat)

### Vector Database: Qdrant Cloud (Recommended)

**Why Qdrant over ChromaDB/Pinecone?**

| Feature | ChromaDB | Pinecone | Qdrant Cloud | Winner |
|---------|----------|----------|--------------|--------|
| Free tier | ✅ Local only | ⚠️ 1 index | ✅ 1GB cloud | Qdrant |
| Multi-collection | ❌ Complex | ❌ Need paid | ✅ Yes | Qdrant |
| Performance | ⚠️ Good | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Excellent | Tie |
| Setup difficulty | ✅ Easy | ✅ Easy | ✅ Easy | Tie |
| Persistence | ⚠️ Manual | ✅ Cloud | ✅ Cloud | Qdrant/Pinecone |
| Open source | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Qdrant/Chroma |

**Recommendation**:
- **Prototype**: ChromaDB (local)
- **Production**: Qdrant Cloud (1GB free tier = ~500 papers)
- **Enterprise**: Qdrant self-hosted

---

### Deployment: Hugging Face Spaces (Recommended)

**Why HF Spaces?**
- ✅ Zero server management
- ✅ Free tier (CPU basic)
- ✅ Easy sharing (URL)
- ✅ GitHub integration
- ✅ Automatic HTTPS
- ✅ Secrets management
- ✅ Popular in research community

**Alternatives**:
- University server (for private/sensitive data)
