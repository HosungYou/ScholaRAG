## Abstract

This presentation introduces **ResearcherRAG**, an open-source AI-powered research system that operationalizes the ACLOD lab's Agentic Human Resource Development Process (AHRDP) theory in social science research practice. ResearcherRAG demonstrates how AI research infrastructure functions as a **proxy agent** that facilitates researchers' **collective agency**, directly addressing the theoretical framework's emphasis on hope as a mediator for positive research outcomes.

Traditional research methods create significant barriers: literature reviews consume weeks of manual work, qualitative data coding requires hundreds of hours, and research note management often becomes overwhelming. These bottlenecks prevent researchers—especially early-career scholars and those at under-resourced institutions—from pursuing ambitious research programs, directly impacting **hopeful career states** (HCS), work engagement, and research productivity.

ResearcherRAG addresses these challenges through three AI systems built using **Claude Code**:
1. **Literature Review RAG**: Synthesizes findings across 200+ papers with automatic citation tracking (reducing time by 10x)
2. **Qualitative Coding RAG**: Accelerates interview transcript analysis from weeks to hours
3. **Research Notes RAG**: Transforms personal knowledge management into collaborative scholarship

Aligned with AHRDP theory, this system positions AI not as a replacement for researcher expertise, but as an **agentic HRD practice** that:
- Removes methodological barriers, cultivating **hopeful career states** among researchers
- Enhances **work engagement** by freeing time for meaningful intellectual work
- Improves **task performance** through comprehensive, rigorous analysis
- Increases **job satisfaction** by reducing burnout from tedious research tasks
- Fosters **collective agency** through shared, open-source research infrastructure

This presentation demonstrates how individual researchers can become **agents who facilitate collective agency** by building and sharing research infrastructure that democratizes access to advanced research tools. By making sophisticated AI systems accessible to all researchers regardless of institutional resources, ResearcherRAG exemplifies how agentic research infrastructure translates into the positive HR outcomes central to AHRDP theory.

## Three Learning Objectives

### Learning Objective 1: Understand RAG as Proxy Agency in Research Practice
Participants will be able to explain how RAG systems function as **proxy agents** within the AHRDP framework, enabling researchers to delegate routine information retrieval and synthesis tasks while maintaining intellectual control. They will identify how AI-augmented research methods contribute to **hopeful career states** (HCS) by reducing time spent on mechanical tasks and increasing capacity for creative scholarship.

**Theoretical Connection:** This addresses the **proxy agency** component of AHRDP, where researchers strategically utilize AI systems as intermediary agents to accomplish research goals that would otherwise require unsustainable time investments.

---

### Learning Objective 2: Recognize the Technical Approach of Building RAG Systems
Participants will be able to describe the basic architecture of RAG systems (document ingestion, vector embedding, semantic search, LLM synthesis) and understand how **Claude Code** enables rapid development of production-ready research tools. They will recognize the accessibility of these technologies for social science researchers without extensive programming backgrounds.

**Theoretical Connection:** This develops **personal agency** through knowledge acquisition about available tools and their capabilities, empowering researchers to envision AI-augmented approaches in their own work.

---

### Learning Objective 3: Envision Collective Agency Through Shared Research Infrastructure
Participants will be able to articulate how shared research infrastructure generates **collective agency** within research communities, translating into positive HR outcomes: enhanced **work engagement** through meaningful intellectual work, improved **task performance** through methodological efficiency, and increased **job satisfaction** through research autonomy. They will identify opportunities to democratize research capacity in their own institutional contexts.

**Theoretical Connection:** This operationalizes the **collective agency** mode of AHRDP, demonstrating how individual researchers become **agents who facilitate collective agency** within their scholarly communities through infrastructure sharing.

## Key Messages Aligned with AHRDP Theory

1. **AI as Proxy Agent:** ResearcherRAG demonstrates practical implementation of proxy agency—researchers maintain intellectual control while delegating mechanical tasks to AI systems.

2. **Hope as Central Mediator:** By removing methodological barriers, accessible research infrastructure generates hopeful career states, particularly for early-career researchers who can now pursue ambitious programs.

3. **Collective Agency Facilitation:** Individual researchers building and sharing infrastructure become agents who facilitate collective agency across research communities.

4. **HR Outcomes Translation:** The system directly impacts work engagement (more meaningful work), task performance (comprehensive analysis), job satisfaction (reduced burnout), and turnover intention (sustainable careers).

5. **Democratized Capacity:** Open-source approach addresses research inequity, enabling scholars from all institutional contexts to access advanced research tools.

## Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q1: Do I need programming experience to use ResearcherRAG?**
A: No. The system includes a web interface (no coding required) and step-by-step guides. For customization, Claude Code allows natural language prompts instead of traditional programming.

**Q2: What are the costs involved?**
A: Minimal. Embedding models are free and run locally. Only LLM API costs apply (~$2-5/month for individual use, ~$30-50/month for small research teams). Documentation includes free/low-cost deployment options.

**Q3: How does this differ from just using ChatGPT for literature review?**
A: ChatGPT has no knowledge of your specific research papers and cannot access recent publications. ResearcherRAG builds a custom knowledge base from YOUR papers, ensuring answers are grounded in your actual literature with automatic citation tracking.

**Q4: Can this work with non-English research?**
A: Yes. The system supports multilingual PDFs. Current implementation focuses on English, but documentation includes customization guides for other languages.

**Q5: How does this connect to AHRDP theory specifically?**
A: ResearcherRAG operationalizes AHRDP by:
- Functioning as **proxy agent** (AI delegates mechanical tasks)
- Enabling **collective agency** (shared infrastructure)
- Generating **hopeful career states** (removing barriers to ambitious research)
- Translating into **HR outcomes** (engagement, performance, satisfaction)
- Demonstrating **agentic HRD practices** in research contexts

**Q6: What about data privacy and confidentiality?**
A: The system can run entirely locally (data never leaves your computer) or on institution-controlled servers. For sensitive data, we recommend local deployment with local LLMs instead of cloud API services.
