## 🎯 What is ResearcherRAG?

ResearcherRAG helps researchers build **custom RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems** for their literature review through **conversational interaction with Claude Code** in VS Code.

### What You'll Build

In 3 hours, you'll create:
- ✅ **PRISMA Systematic Review Pipeline**: Screen 500+ papers down to 50-150 highly relevant ones
- ✅ **Custom Vector Database**: Semantic search across your included papers
- ✅ **Research-Focused RAG**: Query system that cites specific papers with methods and findings

### Why This Approach?

**Traditional Method** (6-8 weeks):
1. Manual database searches (PubMed, ERIC, Web of Science)
2. Export to Excel, read 500+ abstracts one by one
3. Full-text review of 200+ papers
4. Extract findings manually
5. Constantly re-read papers for citations

**With ResearcherRAG** (2-3 weeks):
1. **3-hour workshop**: Build RAG system with Claude Code guidance
2. **2 hours**: PRISMA screens 20,555 papers → 592 papers automatically
3. **Ongoing**: Query RAG for instant answers with citations
4. **Result**: 67-75% time savings, never forget a relevant paper

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

## 📖 How It Works

### The 5-Stage Workflow

```
Stage 1: Research Domain Setup (15 min)
└─→ You describe research topic
    └─→ Claude asks clarifying questions
        └─→ Output: Clear research scope

Stage 2: Query Strategy (10 min)
└─→ Claude designs search queries (broad/focused/narrow)
    └─→ You select and refine
        └─→ Output: Optimized boolean queries

Stage 3: PRISMA Configuration (20 min)
└─→ Collect papers via API (Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex)
    └─→ Claude analyzes metadata
        └─→ Auto-generates research profile (YAML)
            └─→ You review and adjust
                └─→ Run PRISMA screening
                    └─→ Output: 50-150 included papers

Stage 4: RAG Design (15 min)
└─→ Configure PDF download strategy
    └─→ Set text extraction tools
        └─→ Design chunking and embeddings
            └─→ Choose vector database
                └─→ Engineer RAG prompts
                    └─→ Output: Complete RAG configuration

Stage 5: Execution (3-4 hours, mostly automated)
└─→ Download PDFs (2-3 hours, 50-60% success)
    └─→ Extract text (30 min)
        └─→ Build vector database (15 min)
            └─→ Test with sample queries (15 min)
                └─→ Output: Functional RAG system!
```

### Example: Education Research

**Research Question**: "Do AI chatbots improve speaking proficiency in language learning?"

**Stage 1**: Scope defined (higher education, experimental studies, 2015-2024)

**Stage 2**: Query designed
```
(chatbot OR conversational agent) AND
(language learning OR L2) AND
(university OR college) AND
(experimental OR RCT)
```

**Stage 3**: PRISMA screening
- Collected: 568 papers (Semantic Scholar)
- Screened: 342 passed title/abstract (60%)
- Eligible: 139 passed detailed assessment (24%)
- Included: 139 papers for RAG

**Stage 4**: RAG configured
- Embedding: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (local, free)
- Vector DB: ChromaDB (687 chunks, 23 MB)
- System prompt: Academic citations required

**Stage 5**: Execution results
- PDFs downloaded: 75/139 (54%)
- Text extracted: 71/75 (95%)
- Vector DB built: 687 chunks indexed
- Ready to query!

**Query Example**:
```
Q: "What are the main effects of chatbots on speaking proficiency?"

A: Research shows moderate to large positive effects:

**Fluency**: +15-30% speaking rate [Kim et al., 2023, RCT, N=120,
d=0.68, p<.001]. Lower-proficiency learners benefited most [Lee &
Park, 2022, Quasi-exp, N=89, η²=0.42].

**Accuracy**: Significant grammar improvements [Chen, 2024, RCT,
N=156, d=0.51, p<.01], especially syntax errors.

**Confidence**: Increased willingness to communicate after 8 weeks
[Martinez et al., 2023, Pre-post, N=94, d=0.73].

**Limitations**: Most studies <3 months, self-report bias, limited
L1 diversity.
