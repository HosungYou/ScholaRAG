## ðŸ¤” Strategic Questions

### Question 1: Commercial vs. Open Source?
**Options**:
- A: Fully open source (maximize academic impact)
- B: Open core + premium features (sustainability)
- C: Freemium SaaS (commercial focus)

**Current Stance**: A (fully open source) for academic integrity

---

### Question 2: Target Audience Priority?
**Options**:
- A: Focus on social sciences (Education, Psychology, etc.)
- B: Expand to STEM (CS, Engineering, Medicine)
- C: Generalize to all academic fields

**Current Stance**: Start with A, expand to B, generalize to C

- A: Pure IDE (VS Code + Claude Code only)
- B: Hybrid (IDE primary, web for demo)
- C: Web-first (browser-based workflow)

**Current Stance**: B (hybrid) - IDE for power users, web for demos

---

### Question 4: AI Provider Lock-in?
**Options**:
- A: Claude-only (leveraging Claude Code)
- B: Multi-provider (OpenAI, Groq, local models)
