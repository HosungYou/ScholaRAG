# Thresholds - Adjust based on your needs
thresholds:
  screening: 25        # Stage 2 cutoff (expect 50-60% pass)
  eligibility: 45      # Stage 3 cutoff (expect 20-30% pass)
  review_queue: 35     # Manual review needed (scores 35-44)
  min_inclusion: 50    # Auto-include threshold (perfect matches)

# Notes for customization:
# 1. Replace topic_keywords with your specific research focus
#    Examples:
#    - For AI/chatbots: Add "artificial intelligence", "chatbot", "adaptive learning"
#    - For language learning: Add "second language", "L2", "pronunciation", "vocabulary"
#    - For STEM education: Add "mathematics", "science", "problem-solving", "inquiry-based"
#
# 2. Adjust exclusion_keywords based on scope:
#    - If K-12 only: Add "higher education: -10", "university: -10", "college: -10"
#    - If higher ed only: Add "K-12: -10", "elementary: -10", "secondary: -10"
#    - If experimental only: Add "qualitative: -10", "case study: -10"
#
# 3. Tune thresholds after first run:
#    - If too many papers pass (>70%): Increase screening to 30
#    - If too few papers pass (<20%): Decrease screening to 20
